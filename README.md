As part of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd., I worked on Task 2, which involved developing an automated report generation system using Python. The goal of this task was to create a script capable of reading data from an external file, analyzing that data, and then generating a structured and formatted PDF report. This task provided an opportunity to simulate a real-world scenario where data reporting is essential for decision-making and documentation in various sectors.

To carry out this task, I used the IDLE Shell environment for Python version 3.12.2. This development environment allowed me to write and execute Python scripts efficiently. Python was chosen because of its simplicity, wide range of libraries, and strong capabilities in data processing and automation. The entire task was structured into three core parts: reading the data file, performing data analysis, and generating the final PDF report using the FPDF library.

I began by creating a sample data file named data.txt, which contained sales data for a set of products. The data was structured in CSV format with columns such as Product, Quantity, and Price. The Python script used the csv module to read and parse this data. I utilized the DictReader function to conveniently extract the information using column names, and converted the numeric fields to appropriate data types to enable calculations. The script then calculated the total number of items sold and the total sales value by iterating through the dataset.

After analyzing the data, the next step was to create a PDF report that presented the findings in a clear and organized format. I used the FPDF library for this purpose, which allows for the creation of PDF files directly from Python. I defined a custom PDF class that included a report header displaying "Sales Report" and a footer with dynamic page numbers. The main content of the report was a table listing each product along with its quantity sold, price per unit, and total value. In addition, a summary section was included at the end of the report to highlight the total quantity of items sold and the overall revenue generated.

The PDF file was saved as sales\_report.pdf in the project directory. This format made the report easy to share, print, or archive. The script demonstrated how multiple libraries in Python can be integrated to automate a complete workflowâ€”right from reading raw input to producing a polished output document.

This type of report generation system has practical applications in numerous domains. In business, it can be used for generating sales reports, inventory summaries, or invoices. Educational institutions can apply similar systems for student reports, attendance records, or fee summaries. Healthcare providers could use it for compiling patient records or treatment summaries. Even freelancers and consultants can automate billing and timesheet reports using a similar solution. Automated reporting significantly improves efficiency, accuracy, and consistency in data handling.

Working on this task enabled me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. I learned how to handle external files, process data using built-in Python modules, and generate professional documents. The task improved my understanding of automation and its value in reducing repetitive manual work. It also enhanced my problem-solving and programming skills, contributing positively to my learning experience during the internship.
